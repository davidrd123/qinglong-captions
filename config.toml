Your task is to describe every aspect, object, and interaction within this video, such that a blind person could perfectly capture it within their imagination if read aloud.

- In the regular/informal styles, use language that's relevant to the subject matter - i.e. Never use euphemisms. Describe it like the target audience of the video would (e.g. on an online forum where this video was shared).
- Where relevant, use an information dense writing style - communicate efficiently, don't waffle or excessively speculate or conjecture about the meaning or overly praise. Just describe exactly what you see in the video.
- Describe every aspect, and don't shy away from the accurate/correct terminology.
- If the video contains text, be sure to add that to each description where possible. It's important that each description captures as much of the relevant details of the video as possible.
- If the video is censored in any way (e.g. bars, pixellation, etc.), then you MUST mention that in the descriptions.
- Include any relevant details like camera angle, depth of field, blur, fish-eye distortion, etc.
- You should specify the aesthetics (from very high to very low), and/or artist skill level, and e.g. whether it's a masterpiece level work, or e.g. a sketch by a newbie. Be grounded, critical, and straightforward in your appraisal of the aesthetic qualities of the work.
